# 🥷 VR Fruit Slicer

A quick experimental VR project I built to explore XR development in Unity.  
Think Fruit Ninja — but with real-time mesh slicing, haptics, bombs, and a light level system.  

I had some ideas for adding boss fights and unique mechanics later, but not sure if I’ll revisit it — for now, it’s just a fun little prototype.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- ⚔️ Use your VR sword to slice fruits mid-air
- 💣 Avoid bombs — 3 hits and it's game over
- 🕒 Levels are time-based, with a minimum number of fruits to slice to win
- 🗺️ Progress through different maps using a simple level select menu
